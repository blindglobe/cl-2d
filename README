Cl-2d is a two-dimensional graph library for Common Lisp.  It builds
on cl-cairo2 and thus uses the Cairo library, which provides various
backends, including pixel-based (eg PNG, X11) and vector-based (PDF,
SVG, PS) ones.  It is meant solely for 2-dimensional plotting (hence
the name).

Cl-2d is designed to be extensible instead of providing a plethora of
"canned" functions.  Most plots used in scientific visualization are
customized, and the purpose of this library is to make customization
easy.  Plotting happens on frames, which are rectangular areas.  A DSL
is available for splitting frames.  A frame combined with a mapping
from plot coordinates to Cairo coordinates is a drawing area.
Functions named plot-* take a frame, set up and return a drawing area
(on which you can continue drawing), while draw-* functions draw on an
existing drawing area.

See the example/ directory for a wide variety of examples.

This library is still under development, suggestions are welcome.
